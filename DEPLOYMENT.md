# 🚀 Deployment Guide for Liquid Galaxy Painter

This guide walks you through deploying Liquid Galaxy Painter to GitHub Pages with automated CI/CD.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git installed locally
- Modern web browser for testing

## 🎯 Quick Deployment (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Repository
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Name it `liquid-galaxy-painter` (or your preferred name)
3. Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. Don't initialize with README (we have our own files)

### Step 2: Upload Code
```bash
# Clone your new empty repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/liquid-galaxy-painter.git
cd liquid-galaxy-painter

# Copy all project files into this directory
# (All the files from index.html, js/, css/, etc.)

# Initialize git and add files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Liquid Galaxy Painter game"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Pages" in the sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. The deployment workflow will automatically run!

### Step 4: Access Your Game
- Your game will be available at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/liquid-galaxy-painter/`
- Initial deployment takes 2-5 minutes
- Check the "Actions" tab to monitor deployment progress

## 🔄 Automated Deployment

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file automatically:

1. **Validates** all files exist and are properly formatted
2. **Tests** HTML structure and JavaScript file integrity  
3. **Builds** optimized version for production
4. **Deploys** to GitHub Pages on every push to main branch

### Deployment Triggers
- ✅ Push to `main` branch
- ✅ Push to `master` branch  
- ✅ Manual workflow dispatch
- ✅ Pull requests (for validation)

### Workflow Status
Check deployment status:
- Repository → Actions tab
- Look for "Deploy Liquid Galaxy Painter to GitHub Pages" workflow
- Green checkmark = successful deployment
- Red X = deployment failed (check logs)

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Setup Local Server
```bash
# Method 1: Python (recommended)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Access at: http://localhost:8000

# Method 2: Node.js (if installed)
npx http-server -p 8000
# Access at: http://localhost:8000

# Method 3: PHP (if available)  
php -S localhost:8000
# Access at: http://localhost:8000
```

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to code
2. Test locally at `http://localhost:8000`
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
5. Live site updates within 2-5 minutes

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Game Not Loading
- **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
- **Verify CDN links** in index.html are accessible
- **Confirm WebGL support** in your browser

#### Deployment Failed
- **Check Actions tab** for detailed error logs
- **Verify all files** are present and correctly named
- **Ensure proper file permissions** (all files should be readable)

#### GitHub Pages Not Updating
- **Wait 5-10 minutes** for CDN cache to clear
- **Check workflow status** in Actions tab
- **Try hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Debugging Steps

1. **Local Test First**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   # Test at http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Check Workflow Logs**
   - Repository → Actions → Latest workflow run
   - Click on failed step for detailed logs

3. **Validate HTML**
   ```bash
   # Check for common issues
   grep -n "DOCTYPE" index.html
   grep -n "Three.js" index.html
   ```

4. **Test JavaScript**
   - Open browser developer tools
   - Check Console tab for errors
   - Verify all JS files load correctly

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domain
1. Add `CNAME` file with your domain:
   ```bash
   echo "your-domain.com" > CNAME
   git add CNAME && git commit -m "Add custom domain"
   ```

2. Configure DNS with your domain provider:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: www (or @)
   - Value: YOUR-USERNAME.github.io

3. Enable in repository settings:
   - Settings → Pages → Custom domain

### Performance Optimization
The deployment workflow automatically:
- ✅ Validates file integrity
- ✅ Checks CDN dependencies  
- ✅ Optimizes for production delivery
- ✅ Enables GitHub Pages CDN

### Security Headers (Optional)
Add `_headers` file for enhanced security:
```
/*
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### GitHub Pages Stats
- Repository → Settings → Pages
- View traffic and visitor statistics
- Monitor popular content and referrers

### Performance Monitoring
Add to `index.html` for performance tracking:
```javascript
// Simple performance logging
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  console.log('🚀 Game loaded in:', performance.now().toFixed(2), 'ms');
});
```

### Error Tracking
The game includes built-in error handling:
- Automatic error recovery
- Performance optimization
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
