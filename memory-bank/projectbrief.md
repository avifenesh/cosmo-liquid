# Cosmo Liquid - Project Brief

## Executive Summary
Cosmo Liquid is an ambitious interactive 3D physics art creation tool that combines cutting-edge GPU-accelerated particle simulation with scientifically accurate physics modeling. Users "paint" with liquid particle streams in a cosmic environment, creating spectacular visual art while experiencing real physics phenomena.

## Core Vision
Bridge the gap between artistic expression and scientific understanding by creating a tool that is simultaneously:
- A creative sandbox for digital artists
- An educational physics simulator
- A technical showcase of WebGL capabilities
- A gamified experience with achievements and progression

## Key Requirements

### Performance Targets
- **10,000+ simultaneous particles** at 60 FPS
- GPU-accelerated rendering using WebGL 2.0
- Real-time physics calculations
- Dynamic LOD (Level of Detail) system
- Efficient memory management with object pooling

### Physics Simulation Requirements
1. **N-Body Gravitation** with Barnes-Hut optimization
2. **Quantum Mechanical Effects** (uncertainty, tunneling, entanglement)
3. **Relativistic Physics** (time dilation, length contraction)
4. **Electromagnetic Interactions** (Lorentz force, magnetic fields)
5. **Thermodynamic Processes** (phase transitions, crystallization)

### User Experience Goals
- Intuitive controls for non-technical users
- Spectacular visual feedback for every action
- Progressive complexity (simple to start, deep to master)
- Achievement system for engagement
- No installation required (pure browser-based)

## Unique Selling Points
1. **Scientific Accuracy**: Real physics equations, not approximations
2. **Visual Spectacle**: Hollywood-quality particle effects
3. **Educational Value**: Learn physics through play
4. **Artistic Freedom**: Create unique cosmic art pieces
5. **Technical Innovation**: Push browser capabilities to the limit

## Success Metrics
- Smooth performance on mid-range hardware (GTX 1060 or equivalent)
- User engagement time > 15 minutes per session
- Social sharing of created artworks
- Positive feedback on physics accuracy from educators
- Technical recognition from WebGL community

## Constraints
- Must run entirely in browser (no server-side physics)
- Target modern browsers only (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- Initial version without build tools (pure ES6 modules)
- Mobile support deferred to v2.0
- File size < 5MB for initial load

## Risk Mitigation
- Performance: Implement aggressive LOD and culling
- Browser Compatibility: Provide WebGL 1.0 fallback
- Complexity: Progressive disclosure of features
- User Retention: Achievement system and daily challenges
