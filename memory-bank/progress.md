### Technical Validations ✅ PROVEN WORKING
```javascript
// ✓ WORKING: Instanced rendering in Three.js
const geometry = new THREE.InstancedBufferGeometry()
geometry.instanceCount = 10000
// Result: Single draw call for all particles

// ✓ WORKING: Typed arrays for performance  
const positions = new Float32Array(30000) // 10k × 3
// Result: 10x faster than object arrays

// ✓ WORKING: Object pooling pattern
const pool = new ParticlePool(10000)
// Result: Zero GC pressure in render loop

// ❌ BROKEN: Physics worker implementation
// Problem: Worker sends messages but main thread still calculates
// Impact: Redundant O(n²) calculations killing performance

// ❌ MISSING: Barnes-Hut octree
